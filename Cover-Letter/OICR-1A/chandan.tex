To whom it may concern,\\
\\
After seeing this position on WaterlooWorks I was compelled to apply not because of the prestige, but rather the potential to make a difference in the world. I’ve always wanted to be catalyst for change and advancement in the field of medicine.\\
\\
I feel that I strongly connected with the OICR’s mission to implement knowledge, products, and services to improve cancer prevention, detection, and diagnosis. The vision to help patients not only in Ontario but around the world live longer and healthier lives is something I also share.\\
\\
Research and Data science in particular have always been concepts I’ve obsessed about, from a young age I would love to gather data to draw interpolations and make connections between areas of interest. As I grew older I developed a passion for computer science and its ability to process an unimaginable quantity of information, but my love for learning was not restricted to just one domain. I pursued knowledge everywhere, scoring 78th in Canada for the University of Toronto National Biology Competition, and 1st in my school for the Canadian Computing Challenge.\\
\\
Sincerely,\\
Kunal Chandan\\
