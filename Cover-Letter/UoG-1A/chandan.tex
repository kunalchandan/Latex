To whom it may concern,\\
\\
After seeing this position on WaterlooWorks I was compelled to apply not because of the prestige, but rather the potential to make a difference in the world. I’ve always wanted to be catalyst for change and advancement in the field of bioinformatics.\\
\\
The potential to help classify the eukaryotic world help scientists around the world draw mind-bending connections fascinates me. I've always held a particular satisfaction in data science, and being able to work on the forefront of bioinformatics excites me.\\
\\
Research and Data science in particular have always been concepts I’ve obsessed about, from a young age I would love to gather data to draw interpolations and make connections between areas of interest. As I grew older I developed a passion for computer science and its ability to process an unimaginable quantity of information, but my love for learning was not restricted to just one domain. I pursued knowledge everywhere, scoring 78th in Canada for the University of Toronto National Biology Competition, and 1st in my school for the Canadian Computing Challenge.\\
\\
Sincerely,\\
Kunal Chandan\\
