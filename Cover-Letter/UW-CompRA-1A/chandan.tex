To whom it may concern,\\
\\
Once I saw this Computatinal Research Assistant position available on WaterlooWorks I knew I had to apply. I one day hope to become a researcher myself and pursue the fascinating research in applications of computation.\\
\\
The position as a Computational Research assistant is a perfect fit for me, it combines my deepest interests with many of the skills I have gained in the past. I've had extensive experience with MATLAB, Python, and Linux working in the Elder Lab at York U as well as hobbyist interest in writing a Game Engine from scratch, learning Git, LaTeX and data collection by writing my own webcrawlers.\\
\\
Research and data science in particular have always been concepts Iâ€™ve obsessed about, from a young age I loved to gather data to draw interpolations and make connections between areas of interest. As I grew older I developed a passion for computer science and its ability to process an unimaginable quantity of information. I aimed to learn as much as I could as such I founded the first programming team at my school, became the Engineering Lead for our FIRST robotics team and placed 1st in my school for the Canadian Computing Challenge.\\
\\
Thank you for your time in reading this,\\
Sincerely,\\
Kunal Chandan\\
